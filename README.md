This project was bootstrapped with [Create Eth App](https://github.com/paulrberg/create-eth-app).

Duoswap is a clone of Uniswap built on the Goerli Testnet with React and Tailwindcss, and guidance from JavaScriptMastery on Youtube.

You can visit the site at https://duoswap.netlify.app/.

Duoswap only supports Goerli ETH, JSS (Jacob Stein Silver), and JSG (Jacob Stein Gold), which are test ERC20 currencies.

To use, obtain Goerli ETH from https://goerlifaucet.com/.
